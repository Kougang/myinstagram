## Task

As a beginner in React, the challenge of this application was to build a ReactJS application in a harmonious way, while exploring more deeply the concept of components, their real utility, challenges, and benefits. Then, it was necessary to understand the usefulness and application of hooks, their real purpose, as well as other elements like navigation between different components.

## Description

To solve this problem, we used Firebase's cloud service and Firestore for data storage. We primarily utilized **Firebase Authentication**, **Realtime Database**, **Storage**, **and App Hosting**. Additionally, our application is hosted on Firebase. We also relied on YouTube and Google searches to gain a better understanding of the task at hand and the methods to accomplish it.

## Installation

To install the project and its dependencies:

Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone [git](https://github.com/Kougang/myinstagram.git)

Navigate to the project directory:
cd <myinstagram> directory

# Install Firebase:

Create a Firebase account and then run the following command after creating a project. After executing this command, retrieve the next set of instructions in the Firebase console by going to Settings > Overview.

npm install firebase

# Install project dependencies:

npm install or yarn install

# Hosting

npm build

# deploy

npm deploy

suite---

## Usage

To start the project, make sure all dependencies are correctly installed, then run the command `npm start`. You will get the same result as shown on the following link, which contains the hosted version of our application: https://myinstagramdb-59f53.web.app. For styling in this application, we used **Tailwind CSS**.

The available options are as follows:
The user can

- **sign in**,
- **sign up, verify the user name, block sign up if the user name exist**,
- **change password "Settings > "**,

pages
