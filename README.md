## Task

As a beginner in React, the challenge of this application was to build a ReactJS application in a harmonious way, while exploring more deeply the concept of components, their real utility, challenges, and benefits. Then, it was necessary to understand the usefulness and application of hooks, their real purpose, as well as other elements like navigation between different components.

## Description

To solve this problem, we used Firebase's cloud service and Firestore for data storage. We primarily utilized **Firebase Authentication**, **Realtime Database**, **Storage**, **and App Hosting**. Additionally, our application is hosted on Firebase. We also relied on YouTube and Google searches to gain a better understanding of the task at hand and the methods to accomplish it.
